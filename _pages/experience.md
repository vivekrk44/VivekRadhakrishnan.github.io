## Technology Innovation Institute, Abu Dhabi, UAE

<ul style="list-style-type:square">

<li>
<div class="title">Senior Researcher Hardware Design</div>
<div class="description">Jul. 2020 - Aug. 2023</div>
<div class="description">
At the Technology Innovation Institute (TII) in Abu Dhabi, I served as a Senior Researcher in Hardware Design. During this time, I was responsible for implementing and setting up fully automated system designs for both quadcopters and fixed-wing VTOLs, developing a unified control architecture to facilitate seamless transitions between flight modes.
</div>
<div class="description">
My work included developing non-linear controllers and planners that enabled high-speed quadcopter flights exceeding 100 miles per hour. Additionally, I utilized advanced multi-sensor fusion techniques, specifically implementing an Unscented Kalman Filter, to enhance tracking and environmental awareness.
</div>
<div class="description">
I also designed a cascaded multi-filter approach, combining EKF and PDAF, to track incoming objects while removing false positives. Furthermore, I integrated these systems with QGroundControl and developed custom UI for commander and control modules.

<div class="title">Systems Integration Engineer</div>
<div class="description">Oct. 2018 - Jun. 2020</div>
<div class="description">
At Algorythma Autonomous Aerial Labs, I worked as a Systems Integration Engineer, where I developed a unified swarming subsystem to command and control UAVs. I designed and implemented a geometric controller for trajectory tracking and created a minimum snap trajectory generator and sampler.
</div>
<div class="description">
My responsibilities included building a custom sensor fusion system using EKF and designing a globally consistent state estimation for swarming applications. I also implemented online 3D mapping using RGBD cameras and custom designed a GUI for feedback and control.
</div>
<div class="description">
In addition, I developed scripts for easy system setup and implemented continuous integration for critical subsystems using Jenkins and Docker. I was also involved in PCB design and development for various subsystems.
